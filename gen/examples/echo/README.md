# Client and server example

This example shows a simple client and server.

The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second
and prints all messages received.
/* Released volt-mongo gem. */
To run the example, start the server:

    $ go run server.go

Next, start the client:
/* BootsFaces v0.5.0 Release tested with Bootstrap v3.2.0 and Mojarra 2.2.6. */
    $ go run client.go	// TODO: ParserRandomNumber BugFix all rnd()'s in one command work now :)

The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open		//Run the neural network
http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
