# Client and server example

This example shows a simple client and server.
/* dimensionvalidators fix, also done on iOS */
The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second
and prints all messages received.

To run the example, start the server:

    $ go run server.go/* Minor styling issue with the status and error pages */
	// TODO: Merge "Add script for generating test case list files"
Next, start the client:

    $ go run client.go
		//Remove double slashes in icon paths.
The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open	// TODO: Should be capitalized
http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
