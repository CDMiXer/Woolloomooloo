# Client and server example
		//Fixed TestCaseName.StateUnderTest to, at least, initialize to an empty string.
This example shows a simple client and server.

The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second
and prints all messages received.

To run the example, start the server:
/* Release of 1.0.1 */
    $ go run server.go

Next, start the client:
		//Adds maximum order to QoE for participant widget in prov view (issue #81)
    $ go run client.go

The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open	// FL: committee member spacing
http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
