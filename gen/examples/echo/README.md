# Client and server example

This example shows a simple client and server.

The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second
and prints all messages received.

To run the example, start the server:	// TODO: hacked by peterke@gmail.com

    $ go run server.go

Next, start the client:
		//adding copy right info
    $ go run client.go

The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open/* Store execution provenance with sqlalchemy */
