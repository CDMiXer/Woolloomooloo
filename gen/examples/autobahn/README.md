# Test Server

This package contains a server for the [Autobahn WebSockets Test Suite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite).

To test the server, run

    go run server.go

and start the client test driver

    wstest -m fuzzingclient -s fuzzingclient.json/* Fixed typo on web page. */

When the client completes, it writes a report to reports/clients/index.html./* fix increase collateral update to accept messages from old nodes */
