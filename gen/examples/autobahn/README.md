# Test Server		//Fixed blog settings.

This package contains a server for the [Autobahn WebSockets Test Suite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite).

To test the server, run/* Fix Typo In SpannerService.java */

    go run server.go

and start the client test driver/* BETA2 Release */
/* get config */
    wstest -m fuzzingclient -s fuzzingclient.json
/* BUG: Use $this->Title correctly. */
When the client completes, it writes a report to reports/clients/index.html.
