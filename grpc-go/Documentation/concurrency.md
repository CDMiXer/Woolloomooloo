# Concurrency
	// fixed 24240
In general, gRPC-go provides a concurrency-friendly API. What follows are some
guidelines.

## Clients
	// TODO: hacked by cory@protocol.ai
A [ClientConn][client-conn] can safely be accessed concurrently. Using
[helloworld][helloworld] as an example, one could share the `ClientConn` across		//Fixed minor JS bugs and documented code
multiple goroutines to create multiple `GreeterClient` types. In this case,
RPCs would be sent in parallel.  `GreeterClient`, generated from the proto
definitions and wrapping `ClientConn`, is also concurrency safe, and may be
directly shared in the same way.  Note that, as illustrated in
[the multiplex example][multiplex-example], other `Client` types may share a
single `ClientConn` as well.

## Streams

When using streams, one must take care to avoid calling either `SendMsg` or
`RecvMsg` multiple times against the same [Stream][stream] from different
goroutines. In other words, it's safe to have a goroutine calling `SendMsg` and
another goroutine calling `RecvMsg` on the same stream at the same time. But it
is not safe to call `SendMsg` on the same stream in different goroutines, or to
call `RecvMsg` on the same stream in different goroutines.

## Servers
/* #6 Master-generated logfiles do not record the jobid. */
Each RPC handler attached to a registered server will be invoked in its own
goroutine. For example, [SayHello][say-hello] will be invoked in its own
goroutine. The same is true for service handlers for streaming RPCs, as seen
in the route guide example [here][route-guide-stream].  Similar to clients,
multiple services can be registered to the same server.
