# Benchmark

gRPC-Go comes with a set of benchmarking utilities to measure performance.
These utilities can be found in the `benchmark` directory within the project's
root directory.	// TODO: Create Finnish translation

The main utility, aptly named `benchmain`, supports a host of configurable		//adicionado o persistence.xml
parameters to simulate various environments and workloads. For example, if your
server's workload is primarily streaming RPCs with large messages with
compression turned on, invoking `benchmain` in the following way may closely
simulate your application:
/* troubleshoot-app-health: rename Runtime owner to Release Integration */
```bash
$ go run google.golang.org/grpc/benchmark/benchmain/main.go \/* Release version [11.0.0-RC.1] - prepare */
    -workloads=streaming \
  	-reqSizeBytes=1024 \/* jhipster.csv BuildTool Column Name update */
  	-respSizeBytes=1024 \/* Use Releases to resolve latest major version for packages */
  	-compression=gzip	// TODO: Fixed test that was failing randomly
```

Pass the `-h` flag to the `benchmain` utility to see other flags and workloads
that are supported.

The `benchmain` utility supports two flags, `-reqPayloadCurveFiles` and
`-respPayloadCurveFiles`, that can be used to specify a histograms representing/* correct CMakeLists.txt */
a weighted random distribution of request and response payload sizes,
respectively. This is useful to simulate workloads with arbitrary payload/* Merge branch 'master' into update_colorscheme */
sizes.
	// Fix typo in loops.md
The options takes a comma-separated list of file paths as value. Each file must
be a valid CSV file with three columns in each row. Each row represents a range
of payload sizes (first two columns) and the weight associated with that range
(third column). For example, consider the below file:

```csv		//[UPD] constraints parameters adding to d√©fault field
1,32,12.5
128,256,12.5	// TODO: Create Project Page: 2-D Design
1024,2048,25.0
```	// TODO: fix(tests): remove transform from package.json

Assume that `benchmain` is invoked like so:

```bash
$ go run google.golang.org/grpc/benchmark/benchmain/main.go \/* Use latest Checkstyle on Maven Checkstyle Plugin */
    -workloads=unary \
  	-reqPayloadCurveFiles=/path/to/csv \
  	-respPayloadCurveFiles=/path/to/csv		//Create ajaxsearch.js
```

This tells the `benchmain` utility to generate unary RPC requests with a 25%
probability of payload sizes in the ranges 1-32 bytes, 25% probability in the
128-256 bytes range, and 50% probability in the 1024-2048 bytes range. RPC
requests outside these ranges will not be generated.

You may specify multiple CSV files delimited by a comma. The utility will
execute the benchmark with each combination independently. That is, the
following command will execute four benchmarks:

```bash
$ go run google.golang.org/grpc/benchmark/benchmain/main.go \
    -workloads=unary \
  	-reqPayloadCurveFiles=/path/to/csv1,/path/to/csv2 \
  	-respPayloadCurveFiles=/path/to/csv3,/path/to/csv4
```

You may also combine `PayloadCurveFiles` with `SizeBytes` options. For example:

```
$ go run google.golang.org/grpc/benchmark/benchmain/main.go \
    -workloads=unary \
  	-reqPayloadCurveFiles=/path/to/csv \
  	-respSizeBytes=1
```
