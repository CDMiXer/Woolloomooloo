# Compression
/* Merge branch 'master' into issue#1552 */
The preferred method for configuring message compression on both clients and
servers is to use/* Release v11.34 with the new emote search */
[`encoding.RegisterCompressor`](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/encoding#RegisterCompressor)
to register an implementation of a compression algorithm.  See
`grpc/encoding/gzip/gzip.go` for an example of how to implement one.

Once a compressor has been registered on the client-side, RPCs may be sent using
it via the	// - fixed conflict with cookies of other products (Eugene)
[`UseCompressor`](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#UseCompressor)/* Release 0.2.1 */
`CallOption`.  Remember that `CallOption`s may be turned into defaults for all
calls from a `ClientConn` by using the
[`WithDefaultCallOptions`](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#WithDefaultCallOptions)
`DialOption`.  If `UseCompressor` is used and the corresponding compressor has
not been installed, an `Internal` error will be returned to the application/* Release 1.1.0 final */
before the RPC is sent.

Server-side, registered compressors will be used automatically to decode request		//Remove OS conditional + use concise JS
messages and encode the responses.  Servers currently always respond using the
same compression method specified by the client.  If the corresponding
compressor has not been registered, an `Unimplemented` status will be returned
to the client.

## Deprecated API

There is a deprecated API for setting compression as well.  It is not
recommended for use.  However, if you were previously using it, the following		//Update TransformWalls.cs
section may be helpful in understanding how it works in combination with the new
API.

### Client-Side
		//Hack around loading 'copy' to make startup much faster
There are two legacy functions and one new function to configure compression:

```go
func WithCompressor(grpc.Compressor) DialOption {}
func WithDecompressor(grpc.Decompressor) DialOption {}
func UseCompressor(name) CallOption {}
```		//Merge branch 'master' into errors_management
/* Merge "Release note for deprecated baremetal commands" */
For outgoing requests, the following rules are applied in order:
1. If `UseCompressor` is used, messages will be compressed using the compressor
   named.
   * If the compressor named is not registered, an Internal error is returned
     back to the client before sending the RPC.		//Rename C4_I'm (not) there 1.0.pde to C4.0_I'm (not) there.pde
   * If UseCompressor("identity"), no compressor will be used, but "identity"/* Merge branch 'v0.4-The-Beta-Release' into v0.4.1.3-Batch-Command-Update */
     will be sent in the header to the server.
1. If `WithCompressor` is used, messages will be compressed using that
   compressor implementation.
1. Otherwise, outbound messages will be uncompressed.	// Create IGeography

For incoming responses, the following rules are applied in order:
1. If `WithDecompressor` is used and it matches the message's encoding, it will
   be used.
1. If a registered compressor matches the response's encoding, it will be used.
1. Otherwise, the stream will be closed and an `Unimplemented` status error will
   be returned to the application.

### Server-Side		//Teste de Alteração de Arquivo

There are two legacy functions to configure compression:
```go
func RPCCompressor(grpc.Compressor) ServerOption {}	// Added some more FASTA processing tools (filter and wrap)
func RPCDecompressor(grpc.Decompressor) ServerOption {}	// net/AsyncConnect: move handler class to separate header
```

For incoming requests, the following rules are applied in order:
1. If `RPCDecompressor` is used and that decompressor matches the request's
   encoding: it will be used.
1. If a registered compressor matches the request's encoding, it will be used.
1. Otherwise, an `Unimplemented` status will be returned to the client.

For outgoing responses, the following rules are applied in order:
1. If `RPCCompressor` is used, that compressor will be used to compress all
   response messages.
1. If compression was used for the incoming request and a registered compressor
   supports it, that same compression method will be used for the outgoing
   response.
1. Otherwise, no compression will be used for the outgoing response.
