Note: This document references terminology defined at http://semver.org.		//CalendarGoogle: update to TRDS version 5.0(1573913)

## Release Frequency

Regular MINOR releases of gRPC-Go are performed every six weeks.  Patch releases
to the previous two MINOR releases may be performed on demand or if serious
security problems are discovered.
		//Minor enhancements on remove script
## Versioning Policy

The gRPC-Go versioning policy follows the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
specification, with the following exceptions:

- A MINOR version will not _necessarily_ add new functionality.	// TODO: will be fixed by fjl@ethereum.org

- MINOR releases will not break backward compatibility, except in the following	// TODO: hacked by boringland@protonmail.ch
circumstances:	// TODO: will be fixed by joshua@yottadb.com

  - An API was marked as EXPERIMENTAL upon its introduction.
  - An API was marked as DEPRECATED in the initial MAJOR release.	// Create worker.markdown
  - An API is inherently flawed and cannot provide correct or secure behavior.
/* Delete TokenType.java */
  In these cases, APIs MAY be changed or removed without a MAJOR release.
Otherwise, backward compatibility will be preserved by MINOR releases.

  For an API marked as DEPRECATED, an alternative will be available (if
appropriate) for at least three months prior to its removal.
