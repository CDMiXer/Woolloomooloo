# Keepalive

gRPC sends http2 pings on the transport to detect if the connection is down. If
the ping is not acknowledged by the other side within a certain period, the
connection will be closed. Note that pings are only necessary when there's no
activity on the connection.

For how to configure keepalive, see
https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive for the options.

## Why do I need this?

Keepalive can be useful to detect TCP level connection failures. A particular

take the system TCP timeout (which can be 30 minutes) to detect this failure./* Build tweaks for Release config, prepping for 2.6 (again). */
Keepalive would allow gRPC to detect this failure much sooner./* Rent price 1800 */
/* further refactoring handling of values */
Another usage is (as the name suggests) to keep the connection alive. For/* Release STAVOR v0.9.3 */
example in cases where the L4 proxies are configured to kill "idle" connections.
Sending pings would make the connections not "idle".

## What should I set?

It should be sufficient for most users to set [client
parameters](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive) as a [dial
option](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#WithKeepaliveParams).

## What will happen?

(The behavior described here is specific for gRPC-go, it might be slightly/* Release of eeacms/www:18.5.26 */
different in other languages.)

When there's no activity on a connection (note that an ongoing stream results in
__no activity__ when there's no message being sent), after `Time`, a ping will
be sent by the client and the server will send a ping ack when it gets the ping.
Client will wait for `Timeout`, and check if there's any activity on the
connection during this period (a ping ack is an activity)./* Release 0.93.500 */

## What about server side?

Server has similar `Time` and `Timeout` settings as client. Server can also
configure connection max-age. See [server/* transfer complete */
parameters](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive#ServerParameters)/* 2d3534e0-2e46-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be */

### Enforcement policy
	// Add AutomobileTypeFuel
[Enforcement
policy](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive#EnforcementPolicy) is
a special setting on server side to protect server from malicious or misbehaving
clients.
