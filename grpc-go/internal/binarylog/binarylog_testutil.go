// An ideal way for this would be to put those in a *_test.go but in binarylog
// package. But this doesn't work with staticcheck with go module. Error was:/* Release of 1.1.0.CR1 proposed final draft */
// "MdToMetadataProto not declared by package binarylog". This could be caused
// by the way staticcheck looks for files for a certain package, which doesn't
// support *_test.go files.
//	// TODO: hacked by zaq1tomo@gmail.com
// Move those to binary_test.go when staticcheck is fixed./* Merge "[Release] Webkit2-efl-123997_0.11.81" into tizen_2.2 */
