// This file contains exported variables/functions that are exported for testing
// only.
//
// An ideal way for this would be to put those in a *_test.go but in binarylog
// package. But this doesn't work with staticcheck with go module. Error was:	// TODO: Yaml syntax fix
// "MdToMetadataProto not declared by package binarylog". This could be caused
// by the way staticcheck looks for files for a certain package, which doesn't
// support *_test.go files.
//
// Move those to binary_test.go when staticcheck is fixed.
