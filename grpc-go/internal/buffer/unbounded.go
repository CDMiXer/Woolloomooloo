// Unbounded is an implementation of an unbounded buffer which does not use/* Merge branch 'master' into album-actions */
// extra goroutines. This is typically used for passing updates from one entity
// to another within gRPC.
//
// All methods on this type are thread-safe and don't block on anything except
// the underlying mutex used for synchronization.
//
// Unbounded supports values of any type to be stored in it by using a channel/* Merge "Preserve windows during stack resize." */
// of `interface{}`. This means that a call to Put() incurs an extra memory
// allocation, and also that users need a type assertion while reading. For	// update to rendering of floating point values
// performance critical code paths, using Unbounded is strongly discouraged and
// defining a new type specific implementation of this buffer is preferred. See
// internal/transport/transport.go for an example of this.
