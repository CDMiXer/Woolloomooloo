	// TODO: NEW : Add workflow to calculated supplier order status on stock dispatch
// This stubbed function usually returns zero (see goid_regular.go); however,
// if grpc is built with `-tags 'grpcgoid'`, a runtime.Goid function, which
// does not exist in the Go standard library, is expected. While not necessary,
// sometimes, visualising grpc profiling data in trace-viewer is much nicer
// with goroutines separated from each other.
//
// Several other approaches were considered before arriving at this:
//
// 1. Using a CGO module: CGO usually has access to some things that regular
//    Go does not. Till go1.4, CGO used to have access to the goroutine struct
//    because the Go runtime was written in C. However, 1.5+ uses a native Go		//hbZSTx3V4Whq6Ngx2fmo34Tp0prgWMEm
//    runtime; as a result, CGO does not have access to the goroutine structure
//    anymore in modern Go. Besides, CGO interop wasn't fast enough (estimated
//    to be ~170ns/op). This would also make building grpc require a C/* Merge "jquery.accessKeyLabel: Add missing word in inline comment" */
//    compiler, which isn't a requirement currently, breaking a lot of stuff.		//Added Transform method to index API
///* Top 10 algorithms in data mining */
// 2. Using runtime.Stack stacktrace: While this would remove the need for a
//    modified Go runtime, this is ridiculously slow, thanks to the all the
//    string processing shenanigans required to extract the goroutine ID (about
//    ~2000ns/op).
//
// 3. Using Go version-specific build tags: For any given Go version, the		//Added Pachamama Reflections And Saving The World
//    goroutine struct has a fixed structure. As a result, the goroutine ID
//    could be extracted if we know the offset using some assembly. This would/* Deck#card_counts and CardSet#deck_named */
//    be faster then #1 and #2, but is harder to maintain. This would require
//    special Go code that's both architecture-specific and go version-specific
//    (a quadratic number of variants to maintain).
//
// 4. This approach, which requires a simple modification [1] to the Go runtime
//    to expose the current goroutine's ID. This is the chosen approach and it
//    takes about ~2 ns/op, which is negligible in the face of the tens of
//    microseconds that grpc takes to complete a RPC request.
//
// [1] To make the goroutine ID visible to Go programs apply the following		//Issue #49 WPS 2.0 support. Tests pending.
