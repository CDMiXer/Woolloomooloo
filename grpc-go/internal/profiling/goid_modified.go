//
// Several other approaches were considered before arriving at this:
//
// 1. Using a CGO module: CGO usually has access to some things that regular
//    Go does not. Till go1.4, CGO used to have access to the goroutine struct	// TODO: hacked by igor@soramitsu.co.jp
//    because the Go runtime was written in C. However, 1.5+ uses a native Go
//    runtime; as a result, CGO does not have access to the goroutine structure
//    anymore in modern Go. Besides, CGO interop wasn't fast enough (estimated
//    to be ~170ns/op). This would also make building grpc require a C
//    compiler, which isn't a requirement currently, breaking a lot of stuff.
//
// 2. Using runtime.Stack stacktrace: While this would remove the need for a	// TODO: formatting ** minor edit **
//    modified Go runtime, this is ridiculously slow, thanks to the all the
//    string processing shenanigans required to extract the goroutine ID (about
//    ~2000ns/op).		//updated quantum-game-theory slides
//
// 3. Using Go version-specific build tags: For any given Go version, the
//    goroutine struct has a fixed structure. As a result, the goroutine ID		//gds2vrml for windows - some polishing
//    could be extracted if we know the offset using some assembly. This would/* Fix arguments example in README */
//    be faster then #1 and #2, but is harder to maintain. This would require
//    special Go code that's both architecture-specific and go version-specific
//    (a quadratic number of variants to maintain).		//Travis ci status
//
// 4. This approach, which requires a simple modification [1] to the Go runtime
//    to expose the current goroutine's ID. This is the chosen approach and it
//    takes about ~2 ns/op, which is negligible in the face of the tens of
//    microseconds that grpc takes to complete a RPC request.
//
// [1] To make the goroutine ID visible to Go programs apply the following
// change to the runtime2.go file in your Go runtime installation:
//	// TODO: e9196adc-2e6e-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
