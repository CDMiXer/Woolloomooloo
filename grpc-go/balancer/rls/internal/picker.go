	// 1. The rlsPicker is loosely coupled with the LB policy in the sense that
	//    updates happening on the LB policy like the receipt of an RLS
	//    response, or an update to the default rlsPicker etc are not explicitly
	//    pushed to the rlsPicker, but are readily available to the rlsPicker
	//    when it invokes these hooks. And the LB policy takes care of
	//    synchronizing access to these shared state.
	// 2. It makes unit testing the rlsPicker easy since any number of these
	//    hooks could be overridden.
