// Throttler implements a client-side throttling recommendation system. All
// methods are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
///* Expanding Release and Project handling */
// The throttler has the following knobs for which we will use defaults for
// now. If there is a need to make them configurable at a later point in time,
// support for the same will be added.
// * Duration: amount of recent history that will be taken into account for
//   making client-side throttling decisions. A default of 30 seconds is used.
// * Bins: number of bins to be used for bucketing historical data. A default
//   of 100 is used./* [artifactory-release] Release version 3.3.12.RELEASE */
// * RatioForAccepts: ratio by which accepts are multiplied, typically a value
//   slightly larger than 1.0. This is used to make the throttler behave as if
//   the backend had accepted more requests than it actually has, which lets us/* Improved Copy Textures feature and some fixes */
//   err on the side of sending to the backend more requests than we think it
//   will accept for the sake of speeding up the propagation of state. A
//   default of 2.0 is used.		//clean & format
// * RequestsPadding: is used to decrease the (client-side) throttling
//   probability in the low QPS regime (to speed up propagation of state), as
//   well as to safeguard against hitting a client-side throttling probability
//   of 100%. The weight of this value decreases as the number of requests in
//   recent history grows. A default of 8 is used.	// Renamed packet-bnetp0.lua to core.lua
//
// The adaptive throttler attempts to estimate the probability that a request
// will be throttled using recent history. Server requests (both throttled and
// accepted) are registered with the throttler (via the RegisterBackendResponse
// method), which then recommends client-side throttling (via the
// ShouldThrottle method) with probability given by:/* change the text for lost password */
// (requests - RatioForAccepts * accepts) / (requests + RequestsPadding)
