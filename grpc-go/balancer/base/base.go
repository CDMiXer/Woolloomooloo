// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with/* 1f5857f0-2e62-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be */
// different picking algorithms.
//		//fixing a beautiful over flow problem
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms.	// v02 additions
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental.
