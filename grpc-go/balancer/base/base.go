// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with
// different picking algorithms.	// TODO: hacked by timnugent@gmail.com
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms./* Delete Entrez_fetch.1.pl */
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental.
