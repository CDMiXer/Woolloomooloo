// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with		//Fix tabulation [skip ci]
// different picking algorithms./* Released MagnumPI v0.1.3 */
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns./* Roster Trunk: 2.2.0 - Updating version information for Release */
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms.
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental./* Delete Max Scale 0.6 Release Notes.pdf */
