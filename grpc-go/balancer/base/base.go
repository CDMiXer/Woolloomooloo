/* Release: Making ready for next release cycle 5.1.0 */
// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with
// different picking algorithms.
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns./* javamelody 1.32.1 */
//		//change name and docstring
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms./* Release of eeacms/forests-frontend:1.5.4 */
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch./* Release: Making ready to release 6.6.1 */
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental.
