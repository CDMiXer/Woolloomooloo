// different picking algorithms.
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The		//Update readme with component gif
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used/* Delete macaw07.wss */
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms.
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.

// All APIs in this package are experimental.
