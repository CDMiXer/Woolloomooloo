// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with
// different picking algorithms.
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns./* Add section on what to turn in */
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used/* borrar user usuario, leer usuarios, crear usuarios, iniciarsesion */
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms.
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental.
