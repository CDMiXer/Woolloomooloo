// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with
// different picking algorithms.		//Create mysql_multple_instances centos
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
