// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with	// Bugfix: Don't assume all forms have a URLSegment field
// different picking algorithms.
///* Refactor for cleaner code and better API */
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The	// TODO: hacked by ac0dem0nk3y@gmail.com
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms.
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.	// removed headers from mocked requests to fix specs on older rubies
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental./* Merge "Remove unused NTP servers from gps.conf" into jb-mr1-dev */
