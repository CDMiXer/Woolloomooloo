// Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with/* Update bulk upload column order */
// different picking algorithms.
//
// The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The
// provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.
//
// This package is the base of round_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used
// to build round_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms.
// Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer
// builder from scratch.		//fix crasher bug, in subtitle and audio language parser
//
// All APIs in this package are experimental.	// d3db22fc-2e62-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
