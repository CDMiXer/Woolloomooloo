# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition		//updating README.md to reflect pod doc
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior/* Release of eeacms/forests-frontend:2.0-beta.42 */
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:
		//nVu1bNMMZU4vLFb3gMRGA5QTeFw5tOnF
```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \		//e5e10cc6-2e46-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore	// TODO: hacked by xiemengjun@gmail.com
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
