# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services/* Rename java/ProxyPattern.java to java/proxypattern/ProxyPattern.java */

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the/* Added Client ID and Client secret items in configuration file */
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```		//4e5bc73e-2e59-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \/* Release: update to Phaser v2.6.1 */
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
