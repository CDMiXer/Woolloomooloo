# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.		//Update MHW settings with new Iceborne mods
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```		//24046cf8-2e76-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore	// Criação inicial da barra de ferramentas
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
