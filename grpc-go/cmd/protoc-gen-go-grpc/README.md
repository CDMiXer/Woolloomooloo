## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding/* Add Feature Alerts and Data Releases to TOC */
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \/* [artifactory-release] Release version 0.9.2.RELEASE */
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore		//Update estimated code coverage.
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
