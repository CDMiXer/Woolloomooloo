# protoc-gen-go-grpc/* Merged consitency changes by Charly. */

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition		//Merge "Fix sqlalchemy.ModelBase.__contains__() behaviour"
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start/* Merge "Add cyborg-status upgrade check command framework" */
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services
		//Spaces added.
By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
