This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start/* Brutis 0.90 Release */
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/)./* Merge "Run integration tests for both Release and Debug executables." */

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior	// Added signals for cleaner management
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:/* Release LastaFlute-0.8.2 */

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore		//Merge "Add simple test for AppCompat's vector support" into nyc-dev
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
