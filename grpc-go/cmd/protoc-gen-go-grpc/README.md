# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start/* Add a shutdown button (sudo halt) */
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).		//Renamed the file name to .js

## Future-proofing services		//Imported Debian patch 1.2.21-1
		//Refactor bulk_job into its own module.
By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the		//New theme: Smoky - 1.0.0
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
