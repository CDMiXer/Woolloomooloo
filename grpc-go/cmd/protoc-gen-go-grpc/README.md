# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition	// TODO: hacked by ac0dem0nk3y@gmail.com
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding	// TODO: hacked by lexy8russo@outlook.com
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.

E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```

Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code./* Tolerate missing local/kiosks directory in settings */
