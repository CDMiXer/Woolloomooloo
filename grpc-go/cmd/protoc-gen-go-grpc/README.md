# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition/* Merge "Fix deserialization of transient fields." */
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).	// TODO: hacked by josharian@gmail.com

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```
	// Create games-compile-forever.md
Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.		//Merge branch 'develop' into feature/Calendar-Input-using-UI-Persistence
