# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/)./* mineplexAntiCheat > mineplex */
/* Another possible crash fix. */
## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the/* This is one more test */
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.  This is a behavior
change from the grpc code generator previously included with `protoc-gen-go`.
To restore this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`./* Some improvement on pid file handling */
E.g.:
	// TODO: will be fixed by sebastian.tharakan97@gmail.com
```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...]:. \
```
/* Create ogariov3privateservers.js */
Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore
backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
