# Compression/* SO-3109: set Rf2ReleaseType on import request */

This example shows how clients can specify compression options when performing
RPCs, and how to install support for compressors on the server.  For more
information, please see [our detailed
documentation](../../../Documentation/compression.md).

```
go run server/main.go		//QuantifyBamFile shold not process spliced reads in the correct way.
```/* Task #8399: FInal merge of changes in Release 2.13 branch into trunk */
	// TODO: job #9746 backed out some test code
```
go run client/main.go	// TODO: It was OK to use the more accurate BodyGetExtents, if the object is a body.
```	// upgrade to jannot 36
