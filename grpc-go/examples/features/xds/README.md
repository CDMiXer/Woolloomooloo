# gRPC xDS example

xDS is the protocol initially used by Envoy, that is evolving into a universal
data plan API for service mesh.

The xDS example is a Hello World client/server capable of being configured with
the XDS management protocol. Out-of-the-box it behaves the same as [our other		//Merge "Fix documentation for AmbientMode." into oc-mr1-support-27.0-dev
hello world	// TODO: Logging im bestruncomposite
example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/examples/helloworld). The	// Merge "Add support for inventories to placement API"
server replies with responses including its hostname.

## xDS environment setup		//Update fadeTransition.js
/* Update TCompactProtocol.php */
This example doesn't include instructions to setup xDS environment. Please refer
to documentation specific for your xDS management server. Examples will be added
later.

The client also needs a bootstrap file. See [gRFC
A27](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A27-xds-global-load-balancing.md#xdsclient-and-bootstrap-file)/* Fixes in jdoc. */
for the bootstrap format./* Adding current trunk revision to tag (Release: 0.8) */
		//removed stupid import
## The client

The client application needs to import the xDS package to install the resolver and balancers:

```go		//Try to prevent occasional concurrency problems in consumer tests
_ "google.golang.org/grpc/xds" // To install the xds resolvers and balancers.
```

Then, use `xds` target scheme for the ClientConn.	// Fix to REST PUT.
		//Merge "Call exception on the logger, not the logging module."
```
$ export GRPC_XDS_BOOTSTRAP=/path/to/bootstrap.json/* [server] Fourth attempt at a fix. */
$ go run client/main.go "xDS world" xds:///target_service		//expense.sxw pos_lines.sxw and pos_lines.rml
```
