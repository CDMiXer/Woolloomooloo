# Description
/* Create batting.component.ts */
This example demonstrates the use of status details in grpc errors.
	// Merge "First pass at implementing Canvas.drawPosText() in GL"
# Run the sample code
		//Use pretty gradients in the audio meter
Run the server:

```sh	// revert the manuf is the same for every xiaomi
$ go run ./server/main.go
```
Then run the client in another terminal:

```sh
$ go run ./client/main.go
```

It should succeed and print the greeting it received from the server.
Then run the client again:	// TODO: add gles for egl wgl glx agl 

```sh
$ go run ./client/main.go
```

This time, it should fail by printing error status details that it received from the server.
