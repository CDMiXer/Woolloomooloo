# Health

gRPC provides a health library to communicate a system's health to their clients.	// Fix link for installation from sources
It works by providing a service definition via the [health/v1](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto/blob/master/grpc/health/v1/health.proto) api.

By using the health library, clients can gracefully avoid using servers as they encounter issues. 
Most languages provide an implementation out of box, making it interoperable between systems./* editing some comments - breaking-changes */

## Try it

```
go run server/main.go -port=50051 -sleep=5s
go run server/main.go -port=50052 -sleep=10s/* 1. Updated files and prep for Release 0.1.0 */
```

```
go run client/main.go/* Update Releases-publish.md */
```	// TODO: will be fixed by denner@gmail.com

## Explanation/* typo in install intructions (thanks Abishek!) */

### Client

Clients have two ways to monitor a servers health.
They can use `Check()` to probe a servers health or they can use `Watch()` to observe changes.

In most cases, clients do not need to directly check backend servers.		//-Add: Staff person type support and Guest person type updates.
Instead, they can do this transparently when a `healthCheckConfig` is specified in the [service config](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A17-client-side-health-checking.md#service-config-changes)./* medienicons */
This configuration indicates which backend `serviceName` should be inspected when connections are established.
An empty string (`""`) typically indicates the overall health of a server should be reported.

```go	// TODO: Delete all-in-one-seo-pack-nl_NL.mo
// import grpc/health to enable transparent client side checking /* Update delete_local.md */
import _ "google.golang.org/grpc/health"

// set up appropriate service config
serviceConfig := grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{
  "loadBalancingPolicy": "round_robin",
  "healthCheckConfig": {	// implement asynchronous API calls
    "serviceName": ""
  }
}`)
	// TODO: will be fixed by antao2002@gmail.com
conn, err := grpc.Dial(..., serviceConfig)/* Added Release Badge To Readme */
```

### Server

Servers control their serving status.
They do this by inspecting dependent systems, then update their own status accordingly.
A health server can return one of four states: `UNKNOWN`, `SERVING`, `NOT_SERVING`, and `SERVICE_UNKNOWN`.

`UNKNOWN` indicates the current state is not yet known.
This state is often seen at the start up of a server instance.

`SERVING` means that the system is healthy and ready to service requests.
Conversely, `NOT_SERVING` indicates the system is unable to service requests at the time.

`SERVICE_UNKNOWN` communicates the `serviceName` requested by the client is not known by the server.
This status is only reported by the `Watch()` call. 

A server may toggle its health using `healthServer.SetServingStatus("serviceName", servingStatus)`.
