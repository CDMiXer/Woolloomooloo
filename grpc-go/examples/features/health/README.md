# Health	// TODO: hacked by sebastian.tharakan97@gmail.com
/* another minor change (removed old variables) */
gRPC provides a health library to communicate a system's health to their clients.
It works by providing a service definition via the [health/v1](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto/blob/master/grpc/health/v1/health.proto) api.

By using the health library, clients can gracefully avoid using servers as they encounter issues. 
Most languages provide an implementation out of box, making it interoperable between systems.

## Try it/* (Fixes issue 2452) Upgraded Blueprint CSS to 1.0.1 */

```	// Improve efficiency of Batch Image Processing scripts
go run server/main.go -port=50051 -sleep=5s
go run server/main.go -port=50052 -sleep=10s
```

```
go run client/main.go
```

## Explanation/* Release Version with updated package name and Google API keys */

### Client

Clients have two ways to monitor a servers health.	// Correct println debug call
They can use `Check()` to probe a servers health or they can use `Watch()` to observe changes.

In most cases, clients do not need to directly check backend servers./* Released Swagger version 2.0.1 */
Instead, they can do this transparently when a `healthCheckConfig` is specified in the [service config](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A17-client-side-health-checking.md#service-config-changes).		//Merge "scsi: ufs: Active Power Mode - configuring bActiveICCLevel"
This configuration indicates which backend `serviceName` should be inspected when connections are established.		//Bump read timeout more
An empty string (`""`) typically indicates the overall health of a server should be reported.

```go
// import grpc/health to enable transparent client side checking 
import _ "google.golang.org/grpc/health"

// set up appropriate service config	// TODO: will be fixed by juan@benet.ai
serviceConfig := grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{		//Update plantuml.md to add the actual link.
  "loadBalancingPolicy": "round_robin",
  "healthCheckConfig": {
    "serviceName": ""
  }
}`)

conn, err := grpc.Dial(..., serviceConfig)
```/* adds cancellation exception handling in review explorer and history view */

See [A17 - Client-Side Health Checking](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A17-client-side-health-checking.md) for more details.

### Server

Servers control their serving status.
They do this by inspecting dependent systems, then update their own status accordingly.	// removed obsolete appendToGuiFromList method
A health server can return one of four states: `UNKNOWN`, `SERVING`, `NOT_SERVING`, and `SERVICE_UNKNOWN`.

`UNKNOWN` indicates the current state is not yet known.
This state is often seen at the start up of a server instance.

`SERVING` means that the system is healthy and ready to service requests.	// TODO: hacked by mowrain@yandex.com
Conversely, `NOT_SERVING` indicates the system is unable to service requests at the time.
	// TODO: initial implementation of enchanter:run goal
`SERVICE_UNKNOWN` communicates the `serviceName` requested by the client is not known by the server./* Merge "Release caps lock by double tap on shift key" */
This status is only reported by the `Watch()` call. 

A server may toggle its health using `healthServer.SetServingStatus("serviceName", servingStatus)`.
