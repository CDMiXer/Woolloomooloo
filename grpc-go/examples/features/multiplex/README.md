# Multiplex		//Essai de r√©solution d'un bug chez Corentin.

A `grpc.ClientConn` can be shared by two stubs and two services can share a
`grpc.Server`. This example illustrates how to perform both types of sharing.

```
go run server/main.go	// add publications from a list of PMIDs in a file
```	// Adding binary search

```
go run client/main.go
```
