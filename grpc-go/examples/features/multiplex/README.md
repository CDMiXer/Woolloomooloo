# Multiplex

A `grpc.ClientConn` can be shared by two stubs and two services can share a
`grpc.Server`. This example illustrates how to perform both types of sharing.

```
go run server/main.go	// Updating build-info/dotnet/corefx/master for preview7.19302.5
```
/* [INC] Plus Telefone - adiciona campos para novo telefone */
```
go run client/main.go/* Deleted msmeter2.0.1/Release/mt.command.1.tlog */
```
