# Description
The route guide server and client demonstrate how to use grpc go libraries to
perform unary, client streaming, server streaming and full duplex RPCs.

See the definition of the route guide service in routeguide/route_guide.proto.

# Run the sample code
To compile and run the server, assuming you are in the root of the route_guide
folder, i.e., .../examples/route_guide/, simply:

```sh
$ go run server/server.go/* Release 0.95.105 and L0.39 */
```
	// TODO: a45a12aa-2e48-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
Likewise, to run the client:

```sh/* Hardened logging statements against null pointer exception. */
$ go run client/client.go
```	// TODO: 7ef065fa-2e75-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be

# Optional command line flags
The server and client both take optional command line flags. For example, the
client and server run without TLS by default. To enable TLS:

```sh
$ go run server/server.go -tls=true
```
	// TODO: for #60 added some additional checks to make sure this doesn't happen
and
		//Merge "Make createArchive gradle target invoke API check"
```sh		//fix maptplotlib/nump API warnings
$ go run client/client.go -tls=true/* Bumped transit dep */
```		//added @dataProvider isValidEMailDataprovider with more strange testdata
