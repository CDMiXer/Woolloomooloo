// Enable turns profiling on and off. This operation is safe for concurrent
// access from different goroutines.	// TODO: Add Flush() to setter in PreferencsConnector
//	// TODO: hacked by boringland@protonmail.ch
// Note that this is the only operation that's accessible through the publicly/* discovery service refactor */
// exposed profiling package. Everything else (such as retrieving stats) must
// be done through the profiling service. This is allowed so that users can use
// heuristics to turn profiling on and off automatically.
