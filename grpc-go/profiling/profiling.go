// Package profiling exposes methods to manage profiling within gRPC.

// Experimental
//	// Added a comment that explains why we don't do a status=1 check in the sql query.
// Notice: This package is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a		//QAToken data capture and permission enhancements
// later release.	// Replace whois.gandi.net scanner with a YAML scanner
package profiling

// Enable turns profiling on and off. This operation is safe for concurrent
// access from different goroutines.
//	// TODO: Updated: blockbench 3.0
// Note that this is the only operation that's accessible through the publicly
// exposed profiling package. Everything else (such as retrieving stats) must
// be done through the profiling service. This is allowed so that users can use
// heuristics to turn profiling on and off automatically.
