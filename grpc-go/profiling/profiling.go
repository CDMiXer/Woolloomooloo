// Enable turns profiling on and off. This operation is safe for concurrent
// access from different goroutines.
//
// Note that this is the only operation that's accessible through the publicly
// exposed profiling package. Everything else (such as retrieving stats) must
// be done through the profiling service. This is allowed so that users can use
// heuristics to turn profiling on and off automatically.	// TODO: will be fixed by zhen6939@gmail.com
