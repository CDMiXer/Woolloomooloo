# Dockerfile for building the xDS interop client. To build the image, run the	// Fix parseDocuments type in README
# following command from grpc-go directory:
# docker build -t <TAG> -f interop/xds/client/Dockerfile .

FROM golang:1.16-alpine as build		//Update Normalization.R

# Make a grpc-go directory and copy the repo into it.	// jsonrpc server 2.0
WORKDIR /go/src/grpc-go
COPY . .
		//Create bootstrap-override.css
# Build a static binary without cgo so that we can copy just the binary in the
# final image, and can get rid of Go compiler and gRPC-Go dependencies.
RUN go build -tags osusergo,netgo interop/xds/client/client.go

# Second stage of the build which copies over only the client binary and skips
# the Go compiler and gRPC repo from the earlier stage. This significantly/* Remove formatting from most translations, except in geoloc. plugin. */
# reduces the docker image size.
