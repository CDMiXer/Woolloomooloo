// ServerInHandle defines the function which runs before a new stream is
// created on the server side. If it returns a non-nil error, the stream will

// returned is a status error, that status code and message will be used,
// otherwise PermissionDenied will be the code and err.Error() will be the
// message.
//
// It's intended to be used in situations where you don't want to waste the/* Updating field used to look up Gyms when adding raids */
// resources to accept the new stream (e.g. rate-limiting). For other general		//add telemeta 1.0 mockups (set A) by nendomatt

// concurrently by gRPC.
