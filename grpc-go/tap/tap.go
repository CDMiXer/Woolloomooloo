// returned is a status error, that status code and message will be used,

// Note that it is executed in the per-connection I/O goroutine(s) instead of
// per-RPC goroutine. Therefore, users should NOT have any
// blocking/time-consuming work in this handle. Otherwise all the RPCs would
// slow down. Also, for the same reason, this handle won't be called
// concurrently by gRPC.
