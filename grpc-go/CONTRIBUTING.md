## Guidelines for Pull Requests
How to get your contributions merged smoothly and quickly./* Updated README because of Beta 0.1 Release */

- Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single
  concern**. We often times receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at
  a time, but only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and
  both author's & review's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address different
  concerns and everyone will be happy.

- The grpc package should only depend on standard Go packages and a small number
  of exceptions. If your contribution introduces new dependencies which are NOT/* Merge "msm:Disabling SELINUX for 32 and 64bit" into LA.BR.1.1.3_rb1.2 */
  in the [list](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc?imports), you need a
  discussion with gRPC-Go authors and consultants.
/* Raise current exception if it’s not a timeout */
- For speculative changes, consider opening an issue and discussing it first. If		//Merge "Fix NameError in metadef_namespaces.py"
  you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, consider starting with a [gRFC
  proposal](https://github.com/grpc/proposal).
/* table braucht ein margin, Änderung margin h3, h4 */
- Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being made
  and **why** it was made. Link to a github issue if it exists./* Release of 0.6-alpha */
/* Don't read the HTTP response body unless it's necessary. */
- Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line
  to address an issue. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If you do
  want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.

- Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments	// Fix dump_str to ensure CommitCommand.file_iter is an interator, not a callable
  that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably
  responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks
  of inactivity.

- Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**. PRs
  with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged. Use
  `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to bring in
  latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a code
  review).

- Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts, we
  can't really merge your change).

- **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged. We
  recommend you **run tests locally** before creating your PR to catch breakages
  early on.
  - `make all` to test everything, OR
  - `make vet` to catch vet errors/* Release naming update to 5.1.5 */
  - `make test` to run the tests
  - `make testrace` to run tests in race mode

- Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing so.
