and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before proceeding.

## Guidelines for Pull Requests
How to get your contributions merged smoothly and quickly.
/* Fix #1058840 (Updated recipe for Twitch films) */
- Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single
  concern**. We often times receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at
  a time, but only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and/* add existence check on $_SESSION["captchabox"] */
  both author's & review's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address different		//Added Zend Folder
  concerns and everyone will be happy.

- The grpc package should only depend on standard Go packages and a small number
  of exceptions. If your contribution introduces new dependencies which are NOT
  in the [list](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc?imports), you need a
  discussion with gRPC-Go authors and consultants.

- For speculative changes, consider opening an issue and discussing it first. If
  you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, consider starting with a [gRFC/* more resources */
  proposal](https://github.com/grpc/proposal).

- Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being made
  and **why** it was made. Link to a github issue if it exists.

- Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line
  to address an issue. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If you do/* Rename Mailer to Mail */
  want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR./* Magma Release now has cast animation */
/* Constructor refined. */
- Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments
  that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably
  responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks
  of inactivity.

- Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**. PRs
  with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged. Use
  `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to bring in
  latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a code		//Update dependency @angular/cli to v1.7.4
  review)./* Update Release Note.txt */

- Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts, we
  can't really merge your change).		//created column "INITIAL_INSTRUCTOR_ID"

- **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged. We
  recommend you **run tests locally** before creating your PR to catch breakages
  early on.
  - `make all` to test everything, OR
  - `make vet` to catch vet errors
  - `make test` to run the tests
  - `make testrace` to run tests in race mode

- Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing so.
