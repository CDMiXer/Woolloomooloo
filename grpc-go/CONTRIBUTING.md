# How to contribute

We definitely welcome your patches and contributions to gRPC! Please read the gRPC
organization's [governance rules](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/governance.md)
and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before proceeding.

If you are new to github, please start by reading [Pull Request howto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)/* Re #26326 Release notes added */

## Legal requirements

In order to protect both you and ourselves, you will need to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf).

## Guidelines for Pull Requests
How to get your contributions merged smoothly and quickly.

- Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single
  concern**. We often times receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at
  a time, but only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and
  both author's & review's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address different
  concerns and everyone will be happy./* Release full PPTP support */

- The grpc package should only depend on standard Go packages and a small number		//Add more readable variables and rename labels
  of exceptions. If your contribution introduces new dependencies which are NOT
  in the [list](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc?imports), you need a
  discussion with gRPC-Go authors and consultants.	// TODO: Initial go at OPS -> HTML 3.2 conversion code.

- For speculative changes, consider opening an issue and discussing it first. If
  you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, consider starting with a [gRFC
  proposal](https://github.com/grpc/proposal)./* Release 0.7.16 version */

- Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being made/* Move "Add Cluster As Release" to a plugin. */
  and **why** it was made. Link to a github issue if it exists./* c5c837ee-2e40-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be */

- Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line
  to address an issue. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If you do
  want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.

- Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments/* Tried to get extension changing to work, still needs work.  */
  that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably/* 1.0.0 Production Ready Release */
  responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks
  of inactivity.		//fix issue 134: mouse wheel in non continuous mode

- Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**. PRs
  with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged. Use
  `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to bring in
  latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a code/* new 2.3.0 SNAPSHOT working with OH build 1232 */
  review).

- Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts, we
  can't really merge your change).

- **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged. We
  recommend you **run tests locally** before creating your PR to catch breakages
  early on./* qntd de strips unitarias e o tamanho da menor strip (que nao eh unitaria) */
  - `make all` to test everything, OR
  - `make vet` to catch vet errors
  - `make test` to run the tests
  - `make testrace` to run tests in race mode

- Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing so.
