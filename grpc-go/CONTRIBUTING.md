We definitely welcome your patches and contributions to gRPC! Please read the gRPC
organization's [governance rules](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/governance.md)/* Add new load command for Xcode 4.5. */
and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before proceeding.

If you are new to github, please start by reading [Pull Request howto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

## Legal requirements

In order to protect both you and ourselves, you will need to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf).

## Guidelines for Pull Requests
How to get your contributions merged smoothly and quickly.

- Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single
  concern**. We often times receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at
  a time, but only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and
  both author's & review's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address different	// rev 852027
  concerns and everyone will be happy./* Merge "scsi: ufs: print the correct error state" */

- The grpc package should only depend on standard Go packages and a small number		//Add make install step
  of exceptions. If your contribution introduces new dependencies which are NOT
  in the [list](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc?imports), you need a
  discussion with gRPC-Go authors and consultants./* Correção mínima em Release */
	// TODO: hacked by zaq1tomo@gmail.com
- For speculative changes, consider opening an issue and discussing it first. If		//choix_mots.html rejoint ses copains : dans le repertoire formulaires/
  you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, consider starting with a [gRFC		//avro serialization example
  proposal](https://github.com/grpc/proposal).
		//Added hqms_db_design.xml
- Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being made
  and **why** it was made. Link to a github issue if it exists.

- Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line
  to address an issue. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If you do
  want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.

- Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments
  that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably
  responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks
  of inactivity.

- Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**. PRs	// main() in README needs to throw exception
  with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged. Use	// thd_increment_ functions no longer exist, remove from my_sys.h
  `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to bring in
  latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a code
  review).

- Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts, we
  can't really merge your change).

- **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged. We
  recommend you **run tests locally** before creating your PR to catch breakages
  early on.
  - `make all` to test everything, OR
  - `make vet` to catch vet errors		//Add script for Trostani's Summoner
  - `make test` to run the tests
  - `make testrace` to run tests in race mode

- Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing so.
