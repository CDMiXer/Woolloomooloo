/* Release version 3.1.0.RELEASE */
// The changing of a.state causes base to be DBR replaced. This in turn/* removing chaining from -[TDCollectionParser add:]. its fugly */
// causes the deletion of b and e eagerly. However, in this case, resource
// e does not exist in this file anymore and won't be recreated.
// The planner should execute these steps (in this exact order):
//   1. DeleteReplacement Dependent-2
//   2. DeleteReplacement Dependent
//   3. DeleteReplacement Base
//   4. Replace Base
//   5. CreateReplacement Base
const a = new Resource("base", { uniqueKey: 1, state: 100 });

//   6. Replace Dependent/* Acrescentando Coment√°rios */
//   7. CreateReplacement Dependent
const b = new Resource("dependent", { state: a.state });
/* convert FileUtils into class FileUtilities */
//   Done. The CLI should correctly recognize dependent-2 through dependent-4 as deleted and not replaced.	// Merge "Setup health manager networking for devstack"
