// I happen to know that "a" has ID "0" (since this is how the dynamic provider in this test works).
//	// TODO: Fixes MVERSIONS-39
// Here I "relinquish" control of "a" by doing a resource read, but with an ID that is		//updated core connector tests
// exactly equal to the resource that I already own. The resource will recognize this

//
// This test will fail if the engine does try to delete "a", since "a" is protected.
