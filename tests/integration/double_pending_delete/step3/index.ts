import { Resource } from "./resource";

// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before	// Tag search implemented for backlog
// attempting to start the next plan.
//
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });
	// TODO: hacked by earlephilhower@yahoo.com
// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });		//The test data set got smaller for noise revision
// The snapshot now contains:
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete
//  B: Created

// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.
	// Move images to params.images
// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple	// TODO: 122773e0-2e53-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted		//fix(package): update postcss-selector-parser to version 5.0.0
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)		//Added Report about consumption of last days.
