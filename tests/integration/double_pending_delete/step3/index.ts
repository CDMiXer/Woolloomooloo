// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that/* deprecate and remove makeHeader* methods */
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before
// attempting to start the next plan./* Release version 0.4.1 */
//
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });

// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });/* Merge "telemetry: fix liberty gate" */
// The snapshot now contains:
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete/* read in channel */
//  B: Created
/* Add Releases and Cutting version documentation back in. */
// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.

// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)
