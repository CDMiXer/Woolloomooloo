// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state/* Release a hotfix to npm (v2.1.1) */
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before	// delete copy file
// attempting to start the next plan.
///* Fix for GRECLIPSE-1295 and GRECLIPSE-1301 with regression tests. */
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:/* Icecast 2.3 RC3 Release */
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });/* add error logging. */

// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });
// The snapshot now contains:
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete
//  B: Created

// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.

// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)
		//Update i.php
