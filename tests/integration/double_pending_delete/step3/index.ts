// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before
// attempting to start the next plan./* Change $langs by $outputlangs */
//
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });

// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });		//unsecured admin command fix
// The snapshot now contains:/* Update apgtool-gui.py */
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete
//  B: Created

// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.
/* A......... [ZBX-6124] removed unused API methods */
// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted	// TODO: hacked by cory@protocol.ai
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)	// TODO: hacked by lexy8russo@outlook.com
		//Added better nav image to readme
/* Release new version 2.3.29: Don't run bandaids on most pages (famlam) */
