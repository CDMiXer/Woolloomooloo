import { Resource } from "./resource";		//Create Cuisine.js

// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before/* Moving version */
// attempting to start the next plan./* chore(readme): todo and checkboxes */
//
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });

// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.		//Baby steps towards teaching FinalOverriders about virtual bases.
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });/* 1.0.0 Production Ready Release */
// The snapshot now contains:/* minor editorial */
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete
//  B: Created/* Fix #8780 (Don't Show "Unknown Publisher") */

// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.

// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)

/* Update pom and config file for First Release 1.0 */
