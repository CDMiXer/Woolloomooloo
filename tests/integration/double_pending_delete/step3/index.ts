import { Resource } from "./resource";

// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that	// TODO: will be fixed by yuvalalaluf@gmail.com
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before		//Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection
// attempting to start the next plan.
//
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });
		//#206: Audio module reviewed.
// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });
// The snapshot now contains:
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete
//  B: Created
/* core(design): #2 change design */
// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.

// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted	// Added files from Remotetunes plus
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)
