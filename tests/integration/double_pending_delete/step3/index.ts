import { Resource } from "./resource";/* Release: Making ready for next release cycle 5.0.6 */

// The previous plan failed, but we're going to initiate *another* plan that
// introduces new changes, while still keeping around the failed state
// from the previous plan. The engine should delete all pending deletes before		//Update readme to reflect 1.3.x requirement
// attempting to start the next plan.
//
// To do this, we're going to trigger another replacement of A:		//Correct Respite text
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 3 });

// We will still fail to replace B, since fail == 1.		//undefined podcast
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 1 }, { dependsOn: a });
// The snapshot now contains:
//  A: Created
//  A: Pending Delete
//  B: Created		//Removed storage adapter modules

// The A from the previous snapshot should have been deleted.		//Delete DirectX.cpp

// This plan is interesting because it shows that it is legal to delete the same URN multiple
// times in the same plan. This previously triggered an assert in the engine that asserted
// that this is impossible (https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1503)
