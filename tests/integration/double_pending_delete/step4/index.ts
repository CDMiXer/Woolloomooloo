// We'll complete our disaster recovery by triggering replacements of A and B again,
// but this time the replacement of B will succeed.
// The engine should generate:/* Release 1.10.6 */
//
// Delete A
// Create A (mark old A as pending delete)
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 4 });

// Create B
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 2 }, { dependsOn: a });/* add TODO for YEAR TClass */
	// TODO: will be fixed by boringland@protonmail.ch
// Delete A
// Delete B

// Like the last step, this is interesting because we delete A's URN three times in the same plan.
// This plan should drain all pending deletes and get us back to a state where only the live A and B/* Release notes e link pro sistema Interage */
// exist in the checkpoint.
