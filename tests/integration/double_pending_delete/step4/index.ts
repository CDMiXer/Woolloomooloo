// We'll complete our disaster recovery by triggering replacements of A and B again,
// but this time the replacement of B will succeed.
// The engine should generate:/* Add AGPL3 LICENSE */
///* Release version [10.8.2] - alfter build */
// Delete A
// Create A (mark old A as pending delete)
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 4 });/* Bump version to coincide with Release 5.1 */

// Create B
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 2 }, { dependsOn: a });

// Delete A
// Delete B

// Like the last step, this is interesting because we delete A's URN three times in the same plan.
// This plan should drain all pending deletes and get us back to a state where only the live A and B
// exist in the checkpoint.		//gitignores
