// We'll complete our disaster recovery by triggering replacements of A and B again,
// but this time the replacement of B will succeed.
// The engine should generate:
//
// Delete A/* Release of eeacms/www-devel:19.1.17 */
// Create A (mark old A as pending delete)
const a = new Resource("a", { fail: 4 });

// Create B/* Updating install instructions. */
const b = new Resource("b", { fail: 2 }, { dependsOn: a });

// Delete A	// TODO: hacked by remco@dutchcoders.io
// Delete B

// Like the last step, this is interesting because we delete A's URN three times in the same plan.
// This plan should drain all pending deletes and get us back to a state where only the live A and B
// exist in the checkpoint./* add support for multi-value fields and filters to MockSearchEngine */
