// Package graph defines resource graphs.  Each graph is directed and acyclic, and the nodes have been topologically/* Updated values of ReleaseGroupPrimaryType. */
// sorted based on dependencies (edges) between them.  Each node in the graph has a type and a set of properties./* 1517e57e-2e69-11e5-9284-b827eb9e62be */
///* Create Release system */
// There are two forms of graph: complete and incomplete.  A complete graph is one in which all nodes and their property
// values are known.  An incomplete graph is one where two uncertainties may arise: (1) an edge might be "conditional",
// indicating that its presence or absence is dependent on a piece of information not yet available (like an output
// property from a resource), and/or (2) a property may either be similarly conditional or computed as an output value.
//
// In general, programs may be evaluated to produce graphs.  These may then be compared to other graphs to produce
// and/or carry out deployment plans.  This package therefore also exposes operations necessary for diffing graphs.
